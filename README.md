## Deadline: 13th January 2025
## The project goal:
* Write a notebook that will perform a data analysis on data.
* We are to use whatever data series we see fit and draw our own conclusions.
* Create and answer our own questions based on the analysis. 
* Use many of the skills introduced in the module for example databases, Scikitlearn plotting etc.
* For a more in detail look at the assessment brief see [here](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware/blob/main/labs/Project%20Description.pdf)


SQLite is an extension on VS Code that is useful for reading the SQL database we made.
